        Hello!  I am Cris Altman.  I live in Overland Park, KS, a suburb of Kansas City.  I am married with 4 children.  I have a 21 year old daughter, who lives in New York City.
        I have a 19 year old daughter studying at BYUI and living in Rexburg.  My two youngest children live at home, a 17 year old boy and a 14 year old daughter.
        I currently work in the Software Development field as a Software Quality Engineer for a company that specializes in E-Discovery solutions and software.  
        In my spare time, I enjoy playing board games like Ticket to Ride, Gizmos & Castles of Burgundy and refereeing soccer.  I joined the church as a convert during my first stint in college almost 30 years ago.
